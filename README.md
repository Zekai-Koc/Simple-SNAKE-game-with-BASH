# Simple-SNAKE-game-with-BASH (Bourne Again Shell)
A very simple snake game build in BASH (Bourne Again Shell). It needs some modifications, however for starters, it is easy to understand and use.

I tried to keep it simple and easy to use.

1. Assigning initial values for the variables.
2. Create and update a status bar for informing the users.
3. Create and update a score bar for informing the users about the score... 
4. Create the game window (walls).
5. Check the coordinates if the position in our window borders.
6. For different purposes create a random position (row and column).
7. Create the target for eating.
8. Check if there is any target in the window.
9. Loop until crash or quit.
